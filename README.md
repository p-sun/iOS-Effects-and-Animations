# iOS-Effects-and-Animations

A series of projects I converted to Swift3 featuring nice animations and effects. I read each project and marked down the notable techniques.

# Newton's Cradle

A Swift 3 port of [Apple's playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=35) demonstrating how to use [UIKit Dynamics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/animation_and_haptics/uikit_dynamics) to animate collisions, gravity, and add interactivity.
